##Omaha Code School Job Fair Registration

This application was created to allow Job Fair attendees to select their organization to print out a customized 
name badge showing the logo of their organization.

This works great for us because the job fair is not open to the public, 
so we know exactly which organizations will be in attendance and can get the templates ready.

The name badges are printed on demand using a Dymo Labelwriter printer. It uses custom software to 
generate a template that I can interact with using JavaScript.

###Key Technologies
1. Ruby on Rails (probably not needed due to the simplicity of this application)
2. JavaScript
3. Dymo JavaScript Print Library
4. Dymo Labelwriter Software
